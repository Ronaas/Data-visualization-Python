# Data Visualization Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks focused on data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate my skills in **Python**, **data analysis**, and **communicating insights visually**.

## Contents
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Matplotlib & Plotly visualizations
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical summaries
- Interactive charts (where relevant)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Plotly Express  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Learning Goals
Through this project, I focused on:
- Understanding datasets through visual patterns  
- Creating clear, readable charts  
- Cleaning noisy data  
- Transforming raw data into insights
